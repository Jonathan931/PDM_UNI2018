# React Native Charts Wrapper
This library is React Native wrapper of popular Native charting library [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) and [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts)


## Introduction

Inspired by [react-native-mp-android-chart](https://github.com/mskec/react-native-mp-android-chart) and [react-native-ios-charts](https://github.com/Jpadilla1/react-native-ios-charts)

React Native Charts Wrapper is built on MPAndroidChart(v3.0.3) & Charts(v3.1.1), support both android & iOS.

## WARNING

As Swift evolves, if you are not using latest Swift compiler, you shouldn't check out master branch. Instead, you should go to release page and pick up whatever suits you.

* Xcode 10.0 / Swift 4.2 (master branch)
* iOS >= 8.0 (Use as an **Embedded** Framework)
* tvOS >= 9.0
* macOS >= 10.11

* Bar(Stack,Group)

* Scatter
* Bubble
* Pie
* Radar
* Combined
* CandleStick

## Setup

A step by step tutorial to set up a new project can be found [here](https://github.com/wuxudong/react-native-charts-wrapper/blob/master/installation_guide/README.md)


## Usage
There are 8 supported charts with many configuration options.
Almost all configuration available in base MPAndroidChart library are available through this wrapper.
More details on available configuration can be found on their [wiki](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki).

Example of how charts are used and how to apply configuration can be found in example.



## Convention

Android and IOS have different convention:

1. color's alpha in android is 0-255, in ios is 0-1
2. percent in android is 0-100, in ios is 0-1
3. animation.duration in MpAndroidChart is milliseconds, in Charts is seconds.
4. their enum case name is always different, for example XAxisPosition, in MpAndroidChart is BOTH_SIDED, in Charts is bothSided.

**Here we use android Convention**

**Always use processColor to set color**



## Data Format

- Complete Form


		data : {
			...
			dataSets: [
				{
					values: [
						{x: 5, y: 90},
						{x: 10, y: 130},
						{x: 50, y: 2000, marker: "eat more"},
						{x: 80, y: 9000, marker: "eat less"}
					]
				},
				...
			]
		}

marker is optional,  if x is omitted, index will be used.

- Simplified Form

	    data: {
			...
	        dataSets: [
	        	{
	          		values: [5, 40, 77, 81, 43]
	          	},
	          	....
	        ]
	    }

index will used as x.

## Callback

**Support value selection callBack: onSelect**

you can do whatever you want, even pop your own modal, or jump to another page.

**Support gesture callBack: onChange**

check Example->MultipleChart for details.

## Direct Function Call

Support direct function call.

You can use `chart.moveViewToX(...)` or other functions directly.

check Example->MovingWindowChart for details.

supported functions:

1. highlights([...]) 

   it can be used to highlight entries programmatically, or clear already highlighted entries if you pass empty array to it: highlights([])

2. moveViewTo/moveViewToX/moveViewToAnimated/centerViewTo/centerViewToAnimated
3. fitScreen
4. setDataAndLockIndex

   It will rescale and move to the begining of your data when new data is set by default, this is not expected when you want to load more data when user scrolls.  
   setDataAndLockIndex will remain x/y/zoom when you load more data.  
   Because of the implementation of MpAndroidChart, if the action of setDataAndLockIndex is triggered by user dragging,  
   then the range of new data (xMax - xMin) should be equal to original data(this basicly means size of new data equals to old one), otherwise the calculation of position transition won't be accurate,  
   use may find the chart suddenly blink to another position.         
   This restriction only exists in android, in iOS, we have no such problem.
   
   You can check the example InfiniteScrollLineChartScreen.

## Special properties

Several extra properties are introduced:

1. group&identifier&syncX&syncY

   They are useful when you want to implement linkage charts.
   
   Charts will sync its operation to other charts in the same group. All these sync jobs are done at native side.
   
   You can check the example LinkageChartScreen.
   
   Another way of syncing charts is to use onChange, but the performace is poor. 
   You can check the example MultipleChartScreen.
   
   
   There is a stock kLine chart in example, it combines group&identifier and setDataAndLockIndex together.
      

## Custom Marker Content 

Support custom marker content. 

check Example->TimeSeriesLineChart for details.

## Notice

**Several settings are removed.**

1. fontFamily & fontStyle

 Â The font is a little different in android & ios, I don't know how to configure it in js in the same way.
  
**size of chart**

you can set chart to fixed width & height, or flex:1
